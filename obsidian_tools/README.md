# Obsidian Tools

## Introduction

This is a small script to perform some automatic operation over files occuring inside an Obsidian
vault, the idea is to easily allow real time operations (like syncing calendar, managing todos, etc)

## Features

This is a work in progress but I'm hopping that to have enough time to implement the following
features:
- Sync all tasks created in the files to a master TODO.md in the root of the vault
- Allow syncing all the TODO.md tasks to Todoist (or other external tool)
- Download all the calendar events to a daily note
- Add a reference to the day where the file was created
- Automatically create daily notes and other notes

## TODO:
- [ ] Sync all tasks to VAULT_DIR/TODO.md
- [ ] Sync all TODO.md changes to TODOIST
- [ ] Support syncing to other Tasks manangers
- [ ] Download Google Calendar events to daily notes
